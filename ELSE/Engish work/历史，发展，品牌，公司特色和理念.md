## Harley, the symbol of independence and freedom, was once associated with the mere mention of the locomotive. it was a quintessential example of American culture, the spiritual symbol of a generation。But now the brand is in crisis, and we have to change to save it!

## According to the market analysis, most of Harley's fans are now older people, and the younger generation is less interested in motorcycles than their parents. This is mainly due to the high price of Harley and its lack of environmental protection. The average price of our motorcycles is more than $15,000, which is unaffordable for young people. It's also true that young people today are heavily influenced by environmental ideals, and Harley's gas-guzzlers and loud noises are definitely on the opposite side of the environmental issue. We should see a change in times. Maybe we can make smaller, lighter, quieter and more environmentally friendly motorcycles.

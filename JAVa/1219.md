## Hi,everyone. Before my talk,I'd like to thank my roommate Mr Rao who has a cooperation with me and accomplish this talk together. My topic is related with what Harley Davidson to do  which is used to be a popular and successful motorcycle brand all over the world. But now it's facing unprecedented sale difficulties. We are to give a speech from its marketing strategy, innovation and business concept .

##  According to the data analysis, Harley's business cooperation is mainly in the United States. It is better to strengthen the business communication in Asia, especially in China, to create new markets of its own. **Appropriate integration** into some local culture is also a must-see choice.

## The young Americans who used to be crazy about Harley-Davidson are now in their 40s and 50s and young people today don't like outdated motorcycles either owing to diverse choices. At this time, only innovation can break the cold situation. I suggest combing their products with some fashionable stuffs  to cater to the contemporary youngsters . Besides, promote **the idea of competitive sports** to the young and **stimulate their enthusiasm** so that they'll favor it.
